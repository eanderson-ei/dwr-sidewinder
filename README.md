A prototype habitat forecasting application for conservation targets and mitigation needs.

## Dev Setup

To contribute to development, follow steps below.

#### Connect to database

Download and install PostgreSQL. The database is hosted with the app instance on Heroku. Request the database URI from me. See [here](https://eanderson-ei.github.io/ei-dev/data-management/postgres-tutorial/) for step-by-step instructions.

#### Install Packages

Recreate the environment from the `environments.yml` file (`conda env create -f environment.yml`).
